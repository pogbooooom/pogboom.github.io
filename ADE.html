                I am probably nagging with Deligence and members of the community over Ja Morant when i observe a light skinned 
                nigga and serious muscle since jordano walk in together. I am already thinking "is it snowing outside already". Theyre obviously freshers and they have come to purchase 
                from Ekpo Ekpo, fondly known as CSO. Without wasting my breath, i gesture to them to suppress my curiosity. I must have thought i had my ticket to 
                playing basketball ,if not in America, maybe Asia . The way light skinnned nigga had no trouble understanding pidgin, guy,
                otilor o and then muscle said they were cousins, haq. Muscle was already interacting with CSO and i wondered if they had known 
                each other before now. They were Mike and Ailrang as they told their names and hmm, the semester was looking more diverse than ever.
