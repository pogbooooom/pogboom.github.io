        Second year in the university... That only meant one thing! A chance to maximize profit and dominate the largest shares of hostel market!
        Afterall, the name CSO, had not been gotten, it had been earned!     </p>
    <p>
        One thing was certain  in the market. A seller would always go after his debtors. Although school had just resumed, I wasn't slowing down. I had just finished collecting what i was owed from the previous room and was on my way to the next customer on my debt list when i heard someone call out my name,CSO ino.I looked up afar to see it was my senior colleague, Adams. 
        He is standing with a strange face when i hurridly go over to meet him. 
        He collects the book from the unfamiliar face, he was quite tall and hmm, see triceps now. Adam hands the book to me while saying i should be able to 
        handle it. I realize i am looking at a familiar economics assignment from my departmental courses from my previous level and realizes this would be a junior colleague of mine. 
        I burst out laughing as he knows math isn't my strong field and i return the book to my latest acquintance , Mike by name as we get to know each other. 
        Before i left, I offer my assistance in other areas if he ever needed anything not before telling him to visit my room for provisional supplies 
        as the biggest importer on the block. Generally, i was pleased to meet a new colleague as that would make the departmental count rise to 3 in the hostel.

        I am back to my room as more customers troop in to make purchases . My room was always busy as you would hear chants, hailings 
        and gist of all sorts discussed admist all the marketing going on. More importantly, it was the HQ of COMMUNITY and so community men presence
        were always acknowledged. As i attend to customers, i look up to see who has come in and i see my latest colleague and soon to be
         top business customer, an oyinbo besides him. Business almost hasn't looked this promising i assumed. I quickly attended 
         to the duo, giving the best impression while at it as these were not potential customers to joke with. They hung around after bulk purchase to answer questions about their background, relation and school disciplines from other customers, community men and roommates
         . So Ailrang , fair, Mike, Black. Na Ailrang do bulk transfer so, no be Mike.
