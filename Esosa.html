            "I didn't sign up for this", i must have wondered after finding myself in this university and moreso, the hostel.
            I was joined by other freshers, Imoh, Joseph and who was the other person sef?. How i survived with these guys until year 3 is miraculous.

            I had gone to the room next to mine to get some items to clean with and turned out they were fellow freshers like myself. 
            I mean some were asian looking, another,a slim, tender boy and one other ,a big guy. There i got to know them better , most especially Victor who
            would be my ride or die. We  were in the same department , we watched animes, tech savvy. I mean look at us,one could say we were soulmates.

            One noon, i had just returned back to my hostel and while climbing the stairs, i heard dancing queen playing. I  immediatelyjoined in and 
            i was amazed to see it was victors roommate, remember the big guy?  yep! he was playing dancing queen. Almost unbelievable! i mean i wouldn't have taken him to be an ABBA fan let 
            alone singing along to dancing queen. I called out to him and complimented the choice of music and we shared a good laugh. I was a bit sad he didn't know more about ABBA than just the song but 
            there was more to him. He was going to be that 
            
            'chill guy' one needed in his life.
