       I guess i was excited to get my university journey started, At this point, anything except drugs and alcohol
        excites me. I may be a fool, but a fool until i am not.  I know it drives Mike mad considering we used to indulge in heavy drinking once upon a time until 
        Lumiere came along. I guess thats how Lucifer felt when God started showing greater love to Adam and Eve.
        Anyways where was i?

    </p>
    <p>Right! As we all leave the gate to our hostel, i listen and answer some puzzling questions from Mike about the environment
        and i constantly told him that it wasn't that bad. Really, in time you will get to find out. Aside from sitting everywhere of the campus hoping for 
        light, Mike doesn't have what to use against me. I'm derailing from my story aint i?
        okay okay, we get to the hostel eventually and while Mike is busy looking for faults to blame, the rest of us settle in to begin cleaning and arranging the room for our
        own good.

    </p>
    <p>
        About 2pm, after intense cleaning , the weather is so hot we all have our shirts taken off. We come to know the school
        light begins from 7pm and we're eager for some air to cool off.As we await electricity, more students come into the hostel.
        Returning students passing by our room to either identify some properties as theirs from the room a session ago or just exchanging pleasantries.
        Other freshers get ushered into their rooms by the porter. Eventually light comes and the fan doesnt work. You should see the surprise on our faces when we find out no fan in any room works!
    </p>
    <p>
    The next morning, i join Mike to workout and <aside> now that i think back to it, those were peak calisthenic days before the introduction of jordan 2.0. </aside>i get ready to go for orientaion with the boys and some other freshers i got to know over the weekend,including Esosa.

        Esosa stayed in the room opposite us and must have borrwoed our cleaning equipment from the day before. He had come for the equipment, but stayed around like the others did for wonderful vibes. 
        We happpened to be doing the same courses and before you knew it we had exhausted our interests. I got to know his roomates also and
        i must say the start of a solid friendship began that day.
